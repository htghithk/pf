I've been more or less active in the pro-Palestinian scene during the
last year. I wanted to provide some ressources to get started. This [website](https://hillhouse.neocities.org/journal/notes/palestine)
helped me a lot and also gave me the idea to add a few more links that 
might be more valuable for people especially in germany. As you might 
know, since the support of palestine would not benefit the imperialst 
endeavours of the BRD, especially pro-Palestinian protestors are facing
a lot of repressions. Be it at demostrations or even in private spaces.[^4]

## Germany

There is a huge track record of police forces silencing pro-palestinian
voices. Especially in Berlin there were multiple videos protestors who were
brutally knocked down.[^3][^7] Shouts like 

>From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.

are labelled as antisemitic by the german police so be aware of what you
can and cannot say without facing serious repercussions. In most cases 
follow good protest safety measures. Cover up anything that could identify
you in any pictures. Don't go alone. Best case, leave your phone
at home or at least turn it off and disable face-unlocking.[^6]

## Leipzig 

There are some zionist parts of town. In Connewitz, a southern borough of Leipzig for example there
are multiple records of people in keffiyehs being attack by Anti-D
"leftists"[^1] or being denied of entrance into public spaces. Also, venues like venues like Conne Island have a track 
record of years of hosting pro-Israel events.[^2]

The Airport between Leipzig and Halle is, logistically speaking,
one of the most important Airports in all of Europe. Starting here,
many weapons or parts of weapons are being delivered to Israel. There
is an initiative to boycott the distribution of said Airport.[^5]
