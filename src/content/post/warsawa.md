I got inspired by an [article](https://www.greyscape.com/warsaw-packed-with-architectural-gems-lets-walk-and-talk-with-photographer-artur-bednarczy-blok-by-blok/)
about photos by Artur Bednarczyk to walk around the more
suburban parts of Warsaw. My images are by far not as 
breathtaking as they are in the article I just mentioned.
